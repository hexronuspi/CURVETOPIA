This codebase has detection algorithms, 

All the three models `Genetic, Pure Mathematics, and Triangulation` Methods have their own accuracy in detecting shapes.

- Genetic : Straight Line Shapes (Lines, Polygon, Rectangle)
- Triangulation : Overlapping Curves
- Pure Mathematical : >10 shapes in a single image, it can detect contours very effectively.
